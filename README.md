# Introduction to Programming – Python Basics

Welcome to my repository **"Introduction to Programming"**!  
This project contains various exercises and small programs that I created while learning the fundamentals of programming using **Python**.

## 🐍 Why Python?

Python is one of the most popular programming languages in the world. It is especially great for beginners because:

- It has a **clean and readable syntax**
- It offers many **built-in functions and libraries**
- It can be used for **almost anything**: web development, automation, data science, AI, games, and more

## 📂 Repository Contents

This repository includes multiple Python (`.py`) files that cover typical beginner tasks such as:

- Variables and data types  
- Conditions (`if`, `elif`, `else`)  
- Loops (`for`, `while`)  
- Functions  
- Lists, dictionaries, and other data structures  
- Logical thinking and problem-solving tasks  
- Small practice projects
